## My process

1. I designed the site on mobile first and scaled it to desktop.

2. Used sass mixins, sass partials to split the site into smaller components which helps in reducing the rate of causing errors and also sass functions to convert pixels into em and rem units;

3. Flexbox and Grid was used to layout this site from mobile layout to desktop;

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
